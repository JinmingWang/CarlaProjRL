> ### The vehicle agent performs not so well in some situations:
> - It drives too fast, especially for straight aligned waypoints, it accelerates to a very high speed,
> but it sometimes performs a very cool drifting on the bend. I do not think it is serious because the moving direction 
> (steer) is usually correct, speed can be slowed down by simple restrictions.
> - As it sometimes blocks the traffic, other traffic participants may collide with the ego vehicle
> hardly and throw it into the sky, into the trees or into the river, sometimes upside down.
> - The Lidar sensor cannot detect objects that are too close to the vehicle, and objects that
> are not tall enough. So the vehicle may collide with them by not knowing their existence.
> - It needs improvement on reaching target point that on the back of the vehicle.
