> The trained agent behaves poorly in following situations:
1. When the target waypoint is at left or right of the vehicle
2. There are other small objects in front of the vehicle
3. The vehicle is trapped or surrounded by objects

> The next step is to build a variant of VehicleEnv environment called PracticeFieldEnv
> the PracticeFieldEnv is difference in the following aspects:
> 1. the vehicle does not follow pre-generated waypoints, the next waypoint is generated at runtime
> 2. the vehicle is only allowed to move within a limited area, and the waypoint is generated within the area
> 3. the task does not end until the user quits the training program

> The practice fields in the environment are carefully designed, aims to train the agent to master a specific task, 
> such as:
> 1. Reaching waypoints at any direction near the ego vehicle
> 2. Learn how to avoid small objects
> 3. Learn how to get out of a bad situation surrounded by objects
> 4. Learn how to move in a large turning radius
> 5. Learn how to move in a ring road
