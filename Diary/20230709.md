> A bug: RuntimeError: trying to create rpc server for traffic manager; but the system failed to create because of bind error. The reasons is that the traffic manager port is used, probably by a dead process.
1. Use "netstat -tnlp | grep :8000" to find the process that uses the port
2. Use "kill -9 pid" to kill it.
> Now the reward becomes:
- Reach a waypoint: 1 point.
- Collide with anything: -2 point.
- Complete the route: 10 point.
> Now memory tuples can be saved to disk.
> Now dynamic batch size is used, the training function will check the free memory and adjust the batch size.
