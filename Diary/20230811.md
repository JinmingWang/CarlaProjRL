> The final training was successful, the final model work like this:
> 1. Convert the lidar map into simple grid world
> 2. Initialize one pixel at the center of the grid world as the agent
> 3. Train a model to output the next action of the agent, the target is to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles
> 4. The model is trained with A2C algorithm, running this model many times can get a path from the start to the goal
> 5. Train another model using A2C, this model takes the path as input and output the control action of the vehicle
