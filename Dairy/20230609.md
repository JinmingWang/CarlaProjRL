- Able to get vehicle in scenario
- Able to draw route (10 nearest route points)
- Able to see radar points

```python
# In visualize function, the origin location must be changed to vehicle location,
# instead of the radar sensor location, don't know why
...
self.world.debug.draw_point(
    self.ego_vehicle.get_location() + fw_vec,
    size=0.1,
    life_time=0.1,
    persistent_lines=False,
    color=carla.Color(r, g, b))
...
```
- Able to compute distance to the next route point
- Basic reward function that encourages the vehicle to just follow the route
- [ ] (TODO) Get more accurate penalty and reward from carla client
- [ ] (TODO) Make scenario move
- [ ] (TODO) Learn how to use traffic manager to generate traffic, so any map can be used
- [x] (20240610) Design multi thread architecture, another thread for training agent
