- Action definition is changed:
- original: throttle [0, 1], brake [0, 1], steer [-1, 1]
- now: throttle_brake [-1, 1], steer [-1, 1]
- break throttle_brake into 21 bins
- break steer into 55 bins
- action space: 21 * 55 = 1155

- Model output changed to (B, 21, 55)

- Loss function changed:
- TD target = reward + gamma * max_a Q(s', a)
- TD_error = TD_target - Q(s, a)
- Given batch_A: (B, 2)
- Introduce gaussian_maps: (B, 21, 55), gaussian_maps[b] contains a gaussian blob centered at batch_A[b], 
with center intensity Td_error[b], sigma=2
- This can update many actions at the same time



Questions:
- What is real-time? Above 24 fps? How system or just inference?
  - 20 - 30 fps
- Can I use route information? There are route waypoints (more than 5000).
  - No, only use current state
- Traffic manager? How to use it?
- Carla crash when training...
  - Destroy the actor before creating a new one
