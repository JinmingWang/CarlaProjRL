> So many bugs have been solved during the past week
- The bug of data being NaN, causing the loss to be NaN
- Collisions are given positive rewards
- Fail to load model checkpoint because of trying to find checkpoint path in wrong dictionary
- Action standard deviation may be too small, causing the function peak much greater than 1
- Incorrectly computed reward can cause the vehicle to avoid reaching waypoint
- The start point and end point of route are the same, causing the route to have no waypoints in it

> Some efficient changes have been made
- The system now fully depends on LiDAR data, which gives a much better representation of the surrounding environment
- Now policy loss and policy branches in the model are using a different optimizer, which has a 10 times smaller learning rate, this really solves the problem of the policy loss being too unstable
- Since the BGR camera data is not used, they are not saved, this saves a lot of memory, and a larger memory replay buffer can be used
- The model is now much smaller, so greater batch size can be used
- The model can see 4 most recent local maps, so it have not only spacial information, but also temporal information
