- After several days of training, the result does not get better, at least not visually. But I must stop training 
 and start to work on my presentation and report.

> I think the mean reason for the bad result is that the model is not trained long enough. One dilemma I face is that:
> - if I train the model for several days, the result may be better, but if the result is not good due to BUGs or 
  inappropriate design, these days are all wasted, which is a big loss.
> - If I stop the training when it is not improving for hours, I got chance to fix the BUGs or to try other 
  design, but I may miss the chance to get a good result for long time training.
