> Now the environment process will write config to log file

> Lidar sensor is changed, a denser lidar sensor is used, it can provide more stable representation of surrounding 
> environment. Also, the lidar sensor is now placed at 3 meters above the ego vehicle, and fov angle is lowered to 
> -39 degrees, this enables to detect closer objects.

> The project now comes to evaluation and comparison stage:

Several evaluations should be done:

- [ ] Evaluate the performance of A2C agent with N-repeat random actions
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of A2C with usual random actions
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of A2C agent with resnet backbone
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of carla autopilot
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of human driver
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of greedy agent

Test cases:
- [ ] Straight road (Town 01 and Town 05)
- [ ] Turning road (Town 02)
- [ ] Waypoint is at back of the ego vehicle
- [ ] Waypoint is too far away from the ego vehicle
- [ ] The ego vehicle is at a very bad state, e.g. close to the wall, in the corner, etc.

Several considerations:

- [ ] All evaluation should be done with the same environment, including same map and route, same number of vehicles
      and pedestrians.
- [ ] The route or behavior of other vehicles and pedestrians may not be the same, so multiple trials should be done 
      for each evaluation task.

Statistics to be collected:

- [ ] Average time of completing the route
- [ ] Average percentage of route completion
- [ ] Number of collisions
- [ ] Total reward orr penalty gained
-
