> This project comes to an end today, although the result is not good, I learned a lot from it. 
> Unable to train a good model is a big big regret, but I am determined to continue this project and complete it one 
> day. However, I still learned a lot, as listed below:

### **Carla simulator**
> Very interesting, hard to start but convenient and powerful if you get used to it. Around 2 weeks to 1 month is 
  needed to get familiar with it (use it without bug).
### **A2C & RL**
> Gorgeous AI algorithm, insanely hard to train, lots of hyperparameters, many tricks, plenty of 
  unnoticeable but important details, miss one and the whole algorithm fails. But can be widely used since it does 
  not need tedious data annotation. I previously know RL, and one to two weeks are needed to build the entire A2C 
  system with carla simulator, and start to train the model without bug.
### **Imitation Learning**
> First time know about it, very nice idea, it is kind of a supervised version of RL, efficient if good human 
  behavior data is collected. But on the other hand, it requires human to demonstrate the behavior very carefully, a 
  mistake can pollute the dataset and make the model learn the wrong behavior (or not converge at all). Several days 
  are used since I already have thr A2C system.
### **FasterNet Block**
> It is fast enough, truly saves time and computational resource, but it has to be used with other modules since its 
  receptive field is too small.
